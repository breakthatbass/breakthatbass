<summary>About Me</summary>
Im a self-taught software engineer focused in systems programming and embedded devices.
<br>
<br>
For the last decade or so, I’ve been working as a carpenter (as well as working for the Manchester School District at one point). As a carpenter, I mainly did full home remodels and house flips with a partner. After a while I realized it wasn’t a great fit for me long term, so I decided to get into programming since I’ve always been interested in computers and taking them apart. Surprisingly, the problem solving aspect of programming isn’t all that different from carpentry.  
<br>
<br>
I first started by signing up for a month long course that covered basics in JavaScript. I didn't really fall in love with programming until I got away from web development and was introduced to C in the cs50 course. I continued learning by waking up early to code for a couple hours before work. Eventually, I realized I needed to go all in. Now I spend my days programming and picking up a bit of carpentry work on the side occasionally.  
<br>
<br>
My goal is to find a job as an entry level software engineer where I can work with a team, learn from them, solve interesting problems, and provide some value to the team and company.
